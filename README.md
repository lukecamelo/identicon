# Identicon

This is just a little thing I made following a Udemy course. It takes strings and builds little images out of them. Neat! There are a few examples included in the repository for anyone interested.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `identicon` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:identicon, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
